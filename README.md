## Aim:
To implement and understand different sorting algorithms in C++, including selection sort, insertion sort, and bubble sort, and compare their operations.

## Software Used:
- Dev c++
  
## Theory:
Sorting is a fundamental operation in computer science that involves arranging data in a particular order. This assignment explores three sorting algorithms: Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, and Bubble Sort.

1.Selection Sort repeatedly finds the minimum element from the unsorted portion and swaps it with the first element of the unsorted portion.

2.Insertion Sort builds the final sorted array one element at a time by inserting each element in its correct position.

3.Bubble Sort repeatedly compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order, effectively "bubbling" larger elements to the end. Each of these algorithms has different time complexities and efficiencies depending on the input size and order.
